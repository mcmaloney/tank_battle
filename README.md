==== TO DO ====

- Actual trajectory calculation
  - Input launch angle and power (multiplier for max velocity, max power is max velocity * 1.0)

- Scale factor for distances
  - Need to be able to apply force setting (proportionally) to any distance 
  - NYC => Berlin is just proportionally larger than NYC => New Fairfield, but the mechanics are the same
